DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,1,"‘Sailorman, I ’ll give to you"
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,2,"My bright silver penny,"
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,3,If out to sea you ’ll sail me
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,4,And my dear sister Jenny.’
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,5,"‘Get in, young sir, I ’ll sail ye"
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,6,"And your dear sister Jenny,"
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,7,But pay she shall her golden locks
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,8,Instead of your penny.’
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,9,"They sail away, they sail away,"
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,10,O fierce the winds blew!
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,11,"The foam flew in clouds,"
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,12,And dark the night grew!
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,13,And all the wild sea-water
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,14,Climbed steep into the boat;
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,15,Back to the shore again
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,16,Sail they will not.
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,17,"Drowned is the sailorman,"
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,18,"Drowned is sweet Jenny,"
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,19,And drowned in the deep sea
DeLaMare2_Silver_Penny,20,A bright silver penny.

Davis3_Lament_ONeill,2,"“Yes, they slew with poison him, they feared to meet with steel.”"
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,3,“May God wither up their hearts!  May their blood cease to flow!

Davis3_Lament_ONeill,5,II.
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,6,"Though it break my heart to hear, say again the bitter words.”"
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,7,"“From Derry, against Cromwell, he marched to measure swords;"
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,8,"But the weapon of the Sacsanach met him on his way,"

Davis3_Lament_ONeill,12,"Quench the hearth, and hold the breath — with ashes strew the head.  10"
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,13,How tenderly we loved him!  How deeply we deplore!
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,14,Holy Saviour! but to think we shall never see him more.
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,15,IV.
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,16,"Sagest in the council was he, kindest in the Hall"
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,17,Sure we never won a battle — ’twas Eoghan won them all.
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,18,Had he lived — had he lived — our dear country had been free;
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,19,"But he’s dead, but he’s dead, and ’tis slaves we’ll ever be."

Davis3_Lament_ONeill,30,VII.
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,31,"We thought you would not die — we were sure you would not go,"
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,32,And leave us in our utmost need to Cromwell’s cruel blow —

Davis3_Lament_ONeill,36,"Soft as woman’s was your voice, O’Neill! bright was your eye,"
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,37,"Oh! why did you leave us, Eoghan? why did you die?"
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,38,"Your troubles are all over, you’re at rest with God on high;"
Davis3_Lament_ONeill,39,"But we’re slaves, and we’re orphans, Eoghan! — why did you die?”"

Davidson8_Hell,1,‘A letter from my love to-day!
Davidson8_Hell,2,"Oh, unexpected, dear appeal!’"
Davidson8_Hell,3,"She struck a happy tear away,"
Davidson8_Hell,4,And broke the crimson seal.
Davidson8_Hell,5,"‘My love, there is no help on earth,"
Davidson8_Hell,6,No help in heaven; the dead-man’s bell
Davidson8_Hell,7,Must toll our wedding; our first hearth
Davidson8_Hell,8,Must be the well-paved floor of hell.’
Davidson8_Hell,9,"The colour died from out her face,"
Davidson8_Hell,10,Her eyes like ghostly candles shone;
Davidson8_Hell,11,"She cast dread looks about the place,"
Davidson8_Hell,12,Then clenched her teeth and read right on.
Davidson8_Hell,13,‘I may not pass the prison door;
Davidson8_Hell,14,"Here must I rot from day to day,"
Davidson8_Hell,15,"Unless I wed whom I abhor,"
Davidson8_Hell,16,"My cousin, Blanche of Valencay."
Davidson8_Hell,17,‘At midnight with my dagger keen
Davidson8_Hell,18,I’ll take my life; it must be so.
Davidson8_Hell,19,"Meet me in hell to-night, my queen,"
Davidson8_Hell,20,For weal and woe.’
Davidson8_Hell,21,"She laughed although her face was wan,"
Davidson8_Hell,22,"She girded on her golden belt,"
Davidson8_Hell,23,"She took her jewelled ivory fan,"
Davidson8_Hell,24,And at her glowing missal knelt.
Davidson8_Hell,25,"Then rose, ‘And am I mad?’ she said;"
Davidson8_Hell,26,"She broke her fan, her belt untied;"
Davidson8_Hell,27,"With leather girt herself instead,"
Davidson8_Hell,28,And stuck a dagger at her side.
Davidson8_Hell,29,"She waited, shuddering in her room,"
Davidson8_Hell,30,Till sleep had fallen on all the house.
Davidson8_Hell,31,She never flinched; she faced her doom:
Davidson8_Hell,32,They two must sin to keep their vows.
Davidson8_Hell,33,"Then out into the night she went,"
Davidson8_Hell,34,And stooping crept by hedge and tree;
Davidson8_Hell,35,"Her rose-bush flung a snare of scent,"
Davidson8_Hell,36,And caught a happy memory.
Davidson8_Hell,37,"She fell, and lay a minute’s space;"
Davidson8_Hell,38,She tore the sward in her distress;
Davidson8_Hell,39,The dewy grass refreshed her face;
Davidson8_Hell,40,She rose and ran with lifted dress.
Davidson8_Hell,41,She started like a morn-caught ghost
Davidson8_Hell,42,Once when the moon came out and stood
Davidson8_Hell,43,"To watch; the naked road she crossed,"
Davidson8_Hell,44,And dived into the murmuring wood.
Davidson8_Hell,45,The branches snatched her streaming cloak;
Davidson8_Hell,46,A live thing shrieked; she made no stay!
Davidson8_Hell,47,She hurried to the trysting-oak—
Davidson8_Hell,48,Right well she knew the way.
Davidson8_Hell,49,"Without a pause she bared her breast,"
Davidson8_Hell,50,"And drove her dagger home and fell,"
Davidson8_Hell,51,"And lay like one that takes her rest,"
Davidson8_Hell,52,And died and wakened up in hell.
Davidson8_Hell,53,"She bathed her spirit in the flame,"
Davidson8_Hell,54,And near the centre took her post;
Davidson8_Hell,55,"From all sides to her ears there came,"
Davidson8_Hell,56,The dreary anguish of the lost.
Davidson8_Hell,57,"The devil started at her side,"
Davidson8_Hell,58,"Comely, and tall, and black as jet."
Davidson8_Hell,59,‘I am young Malespina’s bride;
Davidson8_Hell,60,Has he come hither yet?’
Davidson8_Hell,61,"‘My poppet, welcome to your bed.’"
Davidson8_Hell,62,‘Is Malespina here?’
Davidson8_Hell,63,‘Not he! To-morrow he must wed
Davidson8_Hell,64,"His cousin Blanche, my dear!’"
Davidson8_Hell,65,"‘You lie, he died with me to-night.’"
Davidson8_Hell,66,‘Not he! it was a plot.’  ‘You lie.’
Davidson8_Hell,67,"‘My dear, I never lie outright.’"
Davidson8_Hell,68,‘We died at midnight he and I.’
Davidson8_Hell,69,The devil went.  Without a groan
Davidson8_Hell,70,"She, gathered up in one fierce prayer,"
Davidson8_Hell,71,"Took root in hell’s midst all alone,"
Davidson8_Hell,72,And waited for him there.
Davidson8_Hell,73,She dared to make herself at home
Davidson8_Hell,74,"Amidst the wail, the uneasy stir."
Davidson8_Hell,75,"The blood-stained flame that filled the dome,"
Davidson8_Hell,76,"Scentless and silent, shrouded her."
Davidson8_Hell,77,How long she stayed I cannot tell;
Davidson8_Hell,78,"But when she felt his perfidy,"
Davidson8_Hell,79,She marched across the floor of hell;
Davidson8_Hell,80,And all the damned stood up to see.
Davidson8_Hell,81,The devil stopped her at the brink:
Davidson8_Hell,82,"She shook him off; she cried, ‘Away![’]"
Davidson8_Hell,83,"‘My dear, you have gone mad, I think.’"
Davidson8_Hell,84,‘I was betrayed: I will not stay.’
Davidson8_Hell,85,Across the weltering deep she ran;
Davidson8_Hell,86,A stranger thing was never seen;
Davidson8_Hell,87,The damned stood silent to a man;
Davidson8_Hell,88,They saw the great gulf set between.
Davidson8_Hell,89,To her it seemed a meadow fair;
Davidson8_Hell,90,And flowers sprang up about her feet.
Davidson8_Hell,91,She entered heaven; she climbed the stair
Davidson8_Hell,92,And knelt down at the mercy-seat.
Davidson8_Hell,93,Seraphs and saints with one great voice
Davidson8_Hell,94,Welcomed that soul that knew not fear;
Davidson8_Hell,95,"Amazed to find it could rejoice,"
Davidson8_Hell,96,Hell raised a hoarse half-human cheer.

DeLaMare1_Ghost,2,"Beyond all dreams to restore,"
DeLaMare1_Ghost,3,"I, from the roots of the dark thorn am hither,"
DeLaMare1_Ghost,4,And knock on the door.’
DeLaMare1_Ghost,5,‘Who speaks?’  ‘I ― once was my speech

DeLaMare1_Ghost,12,‘Long dead these to thine . . . ’
DeLaMare1_Ghost,13,Silence.  Still faint on the porch
DeLaMare1_Ghost,14,Brake the flames of the stars.
DeLaMare1_Ghost,15,In gloom groped a hope-wearied hand
DeLaMare1_Ghost,16,"Over keys, bolts, and bars."
DeLaMare1_Ghost,17,A face peered.  All the grey night
DeLaMare1_Ghost,18,In chaos of vacancy shone;
DeLaMare1_Ghost,19,Nought but vast sorrow was there ―
DeLaMare1_Ghost,20,The sweet cheat gone.

Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,1,"“Get up, our Anna dear, from the weary spinning wheel;"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,2,"For your father’s on the hill, and your mother is asleep:"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,3,"Come up above the crags, and we’ll dance a highland reel"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,4,Around the fairy thorn on the steep.”
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,5,"At Anna Grace’s door ’twas thus the maidens cried,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,6,Three merry maidens fair in kirtles of the green;
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,7,"And Anna laid the rock and the weary wheel aside,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,8,"The fairest of the four, I ween."
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,9,"They’re glancing through the glimmer of the quiet eve,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,10,Away in milky wavings of neck and ankle bare;
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,11,"The heavy-sliding stream in its sleepy song they leave,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,12,And the crags in the ghostly air:
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,13,"And linking hand and hand, and singing as they go,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,14,"The maids along the hill-side have ta’en their fearless way,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,15,Till they come to where the rowan trees in lonely beauty grow
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,16,Beside the Fairy Hawthorn grey.
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,17,"The Hawthorn stands between the ashes tall and slim,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,18,Like matron with her twin grand-daughters at her knee;
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,19,The rowan berries cluster o’er her low head grey and dim
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,20,In ruddy kisses sweet to see.
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,21,"The merry maidens four have ranged them in a row,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,22,"Between each lovely couple a stately rowan stem,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,23,"And away in mazes wavy, like skimming birds they go,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,24,"Oh, never carolled bird like them!"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,25,But solemn is the silence of the silvery haze
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,26,"That drinks away their voices in echoless repose,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,27,"And dreamily the evening has stilled the haunted braes,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,28,And dreamier the gloaming grows.
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,29,"And sinking one by one, like lark-notes from the sky"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,30,"When the falcon’s shadow saileth across the open shaw,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,31,"Are hushed the maiden’s voices, as cowering down they lie"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,32,In the flutter of their sudden awe.
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,33,"For, from the air above, and the grassy ground beneath,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,34,"And from the mountain-ashes and the old Whitethorn between,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,35,"A power of faint enchantment doth through their beings breathe,  35"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,36,And they sink down together on the green.
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,37,"They sink together silent, and stealing side to side,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,38,"They fling their lovely arms o’er their drooping necks so fair,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,39,"Then vainly strive again their naked arms to hide,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,40,For their shrinking necks again are bare.
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,41,"Thus clasped and prostrate all, with their heads together bowed,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,42,Soft o’er their bosoms beating — the only human sound —
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,43,"They hear the silky footsteps of the silent fairy crowd,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,44,"Like a river in the air, gliding round."
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,45,"Nor scream can any raise, nor prayer can any say,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,46,"But wild, wild, the terror of the speechless three —"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,47,"For they feel fair Anna Grace drawn silently away,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,48,By whom they dare not look to see.
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,49,"They feel their tresses twine with her parting locks of gold,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,50,"And the curls elastic falling, as her head withdraws;"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,51,"They feel her sliding arms from their tranced arms unfold,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,52,But they dare not look to see the cause:
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,53,For heavy on their senses the faint enchantment lies
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,54,Through all that night of anguish and perilous amaze;
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,55,And neither fear nor wonder can ope their quivering eyes
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,56,Or their limbs from the cold ground raise.
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,57,"Till out of Night the Earth has rolled her dewy side,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,58,With every haunted mountain and streamy vale below;
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,59,"When, as the mist dissolves in the yellow morning tide,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,60,The maidens’ trance dissolveth so.
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,61,"Then fly the ghastly three as swiftly as they may,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,62,And tell their tale of sorrow to anxious friends in vain —
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,63,"They pined away and died within the year and day,"
Ferguson1_Fairy_Thorn,64,And ne’er was Anna Grace seen again.

Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,1,"Come, see the Dolphin’s anchor forged — ’tis at a white heat now:"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,2,"The bellows ceased, the flames decreased though on the forge’s brow"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,3,"The little flames still fitfully play through the sable mound,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,4,"And fitfully you still may see the grim smiths ranking round,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,5,"All clad in leathern panoply, their broad hands only bare:"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,6,"Some rest upon their sledges here, some work the windlass there."
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,7,"The windlass strains the tackle chains, the black mound heaves below,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,8,And red and deep a hundred veins burst out at every throe:
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,9,"It rises, roars, rends all outright — O, Vulcan, what a glow!"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,10,"’Tis blinding white, ’tis blasting bright — the high sun shines not so!"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,11,"The high sun sees not, on the earth, such fiery fearful show,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,12,"The roof-ribs swarth, the candent hearth, the ruddy lurid row"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,13,"Of smiths that stand, an ardent band, like men before the foe,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,14,"As, quivering through his fleece of flame, the sailing monster, slow"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,15,Sinks on the anvil: — all about the faces fiery grow;
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,16,"“Hurrah!” they shout, “leap out — leap out;” bang, bang the sledges go:"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,17,Hurrah! the jetted lightnings are hissing high and low —
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,18,A hailing fount of fire is struck at every squashing blow;
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,19,"The leathern mail rebounds the hail, the rattling cinders strow"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,20,"The ground around; at every bound the sweltering fountains flow,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,21,And thick and loud the swinking crowd at every stroke pant “ho!”
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,22,"Leap out, leap out, my masters; leap out and lay on load!"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,23,Let’s forge a goodly anchor — a bower thick and broad;
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,24,"For a heart of oak is hanging on every blow, I bode:"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,25,I see the good ship riding all in a perilous road —
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,26,The low reef roaring on her lee — the roll of ocean pour’d
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,27,"From stem to stern, sea after sea, the mainmast by the board,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,28,"The bulwarks down, the rudder gone, the boats stove at the chains!"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,29,"But courage still, brave mariners — the bower yet remains,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,30,"And not an inch to flinch he deigns, save when ye pitch sky high;"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,31,"Then moves his head, as though he said, “Fear nothing — here am I.”"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,32,"Swing in your strokes in order, let foot and hand keep time;"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,33,Your blows make music sweeter far than any steeple’s chime:
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,34,"But, while you sling your sledges, sing — and let the burthen be,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,35,"The anchor is the anvil-king, and royal craftsmen we!"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,36,"Strike in, strike in — the sparks begin to dull their rustling red;"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,37,"Our hammers ring with sharper din, our work will soon be sped."
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,38,"Our anchor soon must change his bed of fiery rich array,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,39,"For a hammock at the roaring bows, or an oozy couch of clay;"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,40,"Our anchor soon must change the lay of merry craftsmen here,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,41,"For the yeo-heave-o’, and the heave-away, and the sighing seaman’s cheer;"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,42,"When, weighing slow, at eve they go — far, far from love and home;"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,43,"And sobbing sweethearts, in a row, wail o’er the ocean foam."
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,44,In livid and obdurate gloom he darkens down at last:
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,45,"A shapely one he is, and strong, as e’er from cat was cast:"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,46,"O trusted and trustworthy guard, if thou hadst life like me,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,47,What pleasures would thy toils reward beneath the deep green sea!
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,48,"O deep-Sea-diver, who might then behold such sights as thou?"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,49,The hoary monster’s palaces! methinks what joy ’twere now
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,50,"To go plumb plunging down amid the assembly of the whales,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,51,And feel the churn’d sea round me boil beneath their scourging tails!
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,52,"Then deep in tangle-woods to fight the fierce sea unicorn,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,53,"And send him foil’d and bellowing back, for all his ivory horn:"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,54,To leave the subtle sworder-fish of bony blade forlorn;
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,55,"And for the ghastly-grinning shark, to laugh his jaws to scorn:"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,56,"To leap down on the kraken’s back, where ’mid Norwegian isles"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,57,"He lies, a lubber anchorage for sudden shallow’d miles;"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,58,"Till snorting, like an under-sea volcano, off he rolls;"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,59,"Meanwhile to swing, a-buffeting the far astonished shoals"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,60,"Of his back-browsing ocean-calves; or, haply, in a cove,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,61,"Shell-strown, and consecrate of old to some Undiné’s love,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,62,"To find the long-hair’d mermaidens; or, hard by icy lands,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,63,"To wrestle with the Sea-serpent, upon cerulean sands."
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,64,"O broad-arm’d Fisher of the deep, whose sports can equal thine?"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,65,"The Dolphin weighs a thousand tons, that tugs thy cable line;"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,66,"And night by night, ’tis thy delight, thy glory day by day,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,67,Through sable sea and breaker white the giant game to play —
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,68,But shamer of our little sports! forgive the name I gave —
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,69,A fisher’s joy is to destroy — thine office is to save.
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,70,"O lodger in the sea-kings’ halls, couldst thou but understand"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,71,"Whose be the white bones by thy side, or who that dripping band,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,72,"Slow swaying in the heaving wave, that round about thee bend,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,73,With sounds like breakers in a dream blessing their ancient friend —
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,74,"Oh, couldst thou know what heroes glide with larger steps round thee,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,75,Thine iron side would swell with pride; thou’dst leap within the sea!
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,76,"Give honour to their memories who left the pleasant strand,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,77,To shed their blood so freely for the love of Fatherland —
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,78,"Who left their chance of quiet age and grassy churchyard grave,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,79,"So freely, for a restless bed amid the tossing wave —"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,80,"Oh, though our anchor may not be all I have fondly sung,"
Ferguson3_Forging_of_Anchor,81,"Honour him for their memory, whose bones he goes among!"
